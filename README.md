# TaskZilla

A web app to motivate people to contribute to Open Source and/or NGOs by gamifying the volunteering process.

**This is still a work in progress**

The workflow is similar to the BugZilla apps used by most Open Source organizations, except we intend on gamifying the process of doing tasks and volunteering for organizations. For example, users will have fun sprites, and earn rewards like 'coins' or 'gold' as they complete more tasks.

We hope to inspire people to continue the good work being done by these organizations and impact more lives!

## Todo
* Add email functionality to subscribers list for each task. Currently, users are simply getting added to the list, but aren't receiving any email updates to new activity on the threads.
* Make it fun! Need to work on making the web design creative and original. Also, designing the graphics of the sprites and the various other in-game rewards.
* Figure out the in-game logistics. Reward system? Points for volunteering hours? Milestones or 'levels' for certain blocks of points earned? Buying real-life swag with points?
* Custom admin panel for organizations
